# MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECT

Build a Classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

 Loaded a historical dataset from  loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. 
 Used the following algorithms to build your models:

k-Nearest Neighbour

Decision Tree

Support Vector Machine

Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

Jaccard index

F1-score

LogLoass
